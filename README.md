This is my personal coding journey follow me as I learn, feel free to make fun of me!



**THIS IS A SELF REMINDER FOR SOME GIT COMMANDS**

git pull: Pulls all updates into local computer
git remote add origin https://github.com/Malo-one2000/Coding-Journey.git: Pushes local files to github
git branch -M main: adds the push to the main branch
git push origin main: just to top it off i dont really know what it
