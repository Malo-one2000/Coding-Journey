      <h3>Day One, December 1st.</h3>
<p>I am ready for the day this is my virtual diary number one. Today Logan is trying to reset up my airpods. He failed but he is going to take them over the weekend to try and do it. Today is December first! It's Christmas time and I can't wait to get started!.</p>

<h2>Period 2</h2>
<p>We started with a  blooket and I was very bored, now we are doing notes based on the plate techtonics in the Earth. Most of it was review so I wasn't really into it, I couldn't wait for the class to end and go t my favorite period.</p>
